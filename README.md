# 🎢 Roller Coaster EDA Project

This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset of roller coasters across the world using Python. The goal is to extract meaningful insights and trends about coaster types, speeds, heights, and more.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset contains details like:
- Coaster name
- Location
- Status (operational/removed)
- Manufacturer
- Year introduced
- Height, speed, inversions, etc.

✅ Dataset is included in this repository as `roller_coaster.csv`.

## 📊 Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- NumPy
- SciPy

## 📌 Key Analysis Done

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Handling duplicates and missing values
- Visualizing distributions (speed, height, year)
- KDE plots to show smooth distributions
- Insights about manufacturers, coaster types, and trends over years
